# Blood-Donations-Prediction
Building a binary classifier to predict if a blood donor is likely to donate again.

## Project description 

Blood transfusion saves lives from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/blood-transfusion-what-to-know#1), "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year." Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem. In January 2019, "Nationwide, the [Red Cross](https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/red-cross-in-blood-donation-crisis) saw 27,000 fewer blood donations over the holidays than they see at other times of the year." Machine learning can be used to learn the patterns in the data to help to predict future blood donations and therefore save more lives.

In this Project, we work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset, obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center), consists of a random sample of 748 donors. 
Our task is to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window. We build up a full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to using the tpot library to automate our machine learning pipeline.
